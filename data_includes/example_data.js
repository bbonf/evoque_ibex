shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.", "And that it's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.", "So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible,", "that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.", "But in fact, they're growing faster.", "Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago, which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice,", "and it's the lowest by far.", "And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.", "So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties in fact,", "you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative, because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel.", "No, no!", "In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very

result of that was pretty dramatic.", "After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.", "So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, and it heats up after these volcanoes.", "But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.", "There's no big mystery about it.", "There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects, like it partially destroys the ozone layer and I'll get to that in a minute.", "But it clearly cools down.", "And one other thing: it's fast.", "It's really important to say.", "So much of the other things that we ought to do, like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.", "And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations, because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,", "is the sum of emissions over time.", "So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.", "But if you do this, it's quick.", "And there are times you might like to do something quick.",

talked about doing was geo-engineering.", "It didn't even talk about cutting emissions, which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.", "I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.",

Johnson report, and the various reports of the US National Academy 1977,", "1982, 1990  people always talked about this idea.", "Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.",

allowed to speak about it.", "But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe,", "given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts, we should think about things like this.", "He said roughly what's been said before.", "The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.", "And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this, even though there will be some ozone impacts.", "And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.", "There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world, 'going right down to ''Dr Strangelove Saves the Earth,", "'' from the Economist.'", "And that got me thinking.", "I've worked on this topic on and off, but not so much technically.", "And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.", "And I thought about this child's toy hence, the title of my talk and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer,", "to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there.", "One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.", "The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer, and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.", "And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.", "It was very hard to calculate from first principles.", "I was stumped.", "But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.", "So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,", "that already have this effect.", "I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.", "There are a lot of fun complexities that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.", "But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and

course, we may be wrong this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it but so far,", "it seems good.", "But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes much longer than before because they're levitated.", "We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere, in principle solving the ozone problem.", "I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.", "Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles, so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.", "Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet, where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,", "which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.", "This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially, a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.", "Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right, I think it's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.", "That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this, it's amazing how we can affect the planet.", "The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.", "This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not, give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,", "to control the planet, to give us weather and climate control  not because we plan it, not because we want it,", "just because science delivers it to us bit by bit, with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it.", "Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.", "Maybe they're going to land at the UN headquarters down the road here, or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.", "And the box has two knobs.", "One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.", "Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.", "You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.", "Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.", "We have no global governance.", "And different people will have different places they want it set.", "Now, I don't think that's going to happen.", "It's not very likely.", "But we're building that box.", "The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece, in their labs.", "Even when they're doing it for other reasons.", "Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.", "They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.", "They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.", "And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it I do not but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.", "Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this, and it's better if we think hard about it,", "even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.", "I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it.", "But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.", "We need a broader debate.", "A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers, who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are.", "So here's one way to think about it, which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.", "I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.", "It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with, you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.", "It's very cheap.", "We have a lot of leverage.", "It's not a good idea, but it's just important.", "I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.", "And that calculation isn't much in dispute.", "You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real.", "So because of this, we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions, and just as the concentrations go up,", "we can increase the amount of geo-engineering.", "I don't think anybody takes that seriously.", "Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away from the current climate.", "We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.", "Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.", "But here's a case which is harder to reject.", "Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do, which is get serious about cutting emissions.", "But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.", "There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.", "So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes, but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations.", "And maybe someday like 2075, October 23 we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side.", "And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to you know, we've seen the worst of it.", "But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next 100 years,", "and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.", "That's an absolutely possible scenario.", "We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.", "And that's a very different way to look at the problem.", "It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.", "It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.", "But there is a problem with that view.", "And the problem is the following: knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome,", "and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.", "This is what economists call a moral hazard.", "And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about, and, in general,", "I think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.", "But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.", "I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.", "Should we do serious research on this topic?", "Should we have a national research program that looks at this?", "Not just at how you would do it better, but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.", "Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side, some in a negative side but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.", "A very small amount of money would get us some.", "Many of us maybe now me think we should do that.", "But I have a lot of reservations.", "My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem, and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.", "I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this, people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.", "Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.", "A treaty that decides who gets to do this.", "Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the US doing this.", "But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,", "they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this, and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world than a non-geo-engineered world.", "And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.", "So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better 25 years ago in the US National Academy report than I can say today.", "And I think it really summarizes where we are here.", "That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions but also,", "I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not.", "And it's time to begin thinking about it, even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it.", "Thank you very much."],

Curragh which is", "##1## That's right", "##0## One of the I suppose the most famous", "##1## Stop it Jenny", "##1## Yes", "##0## Parts of the world for horses and racing", "##1## Yes it's lovely in Kildare", "##1## My husband uh was running a stud there for Paddy Prendergast the late Paddy Prendergast and I used to ride out for for four years I rode out on the race horses and that really was it was really enjoyable both the breeding the the foals coming every spring and the you know the young animals working with them and then of course the th' actual riding", "##1## I found it very thrilling", "##0## So at that stage you were a wife a mother of two children", "##1## And a teacher", "##0## And a teacher and what was it then that was within you do you think that was calling you towards the church or was that something that at that stage didn't make itself evident", "##1## No no that was quite dormant at that stage totally dormant", "##1## I mean of course we were churchgoers and church supporters and so on but entering the church had never entered my mind at that stage", "##0## Well Florence uh life took a dramatic turn for you in nineteen eighty-five when when your husband was killed very suddenly", "##1## That's right yes that's right uhm it did", "##1## Frank was killed in an accident", "##1## He was driving home from work one evening and he met an empty turf lorry", "##1## And you know how if they're bringing a very large load of turf they usually increase the the amount they can take by putting great big wooden gates on the top with steel or iron supports so those hadn't been properly secured and unfortunately as his car met the lorry one of these fell on top of his car", "##1## So that was certainly very unexpected and you know quite a shock", "##1## Took me quite a while to get over that", "##0## So there you were unexpectantly widowed and two children to take care of", "##1## Mhm yes that's right", "##1## Uh-huh that's right", "##1## Well they were pretty well grown up at that time", "##1## David was in his final year at the Veterinary College so a bit worried at that time in case it might uh cause him to fail his final exams but fortunately it didn't", "##1## He got through", "##1## Sheena of course she was in the working in the Northern Bank at that time", "##1## She 'd just entered the Northern Bank so they were both really pretty well advanced as regards both education and age", "##0## How did you set about picking up the pieces", "##1## Well it took some time", "##1## It took quite a few months actually", "##1## But then as I say I just decided that I would go back to college", "##1## I 'd always wanted to was never able to because of well family commitments and finance and so on or lack of finance I should say and uhm I just decided this was the chance", "##1## I would go back to university", "##1## And I was actually late with my applications of course by the time I picked myself up and decide to do this but I just managed to get in to be accepted", "##0## And what had you thought to do", "##1## Oh yes well I 'd thought of doing either French or music", "##1## And as I say I just don't know why I ended up doing theology but I did", "##1## I don't think anybody suggested it to me", "##1## I presume it was just God's prompting if you like but I ended up doing theology and enjoyed it", "##0## And then when did you think well maybe I should see if I can put myself forward and become more actively involved in the church", "##1## Well I acted as a summer assistant for two summers in Ballybay in County Monaghan Second Ballybay Church where there was a vacancy", "##1## And uhm I enjoyed doing that", "##1## But again although I was doing that for those summers I still was not thinking of doing it as a full-time occupation as I until my final year and then people said you don't want to waste all you 've learned you want to put into practice would you not maybe think of the church", "##1## And then I thought right I 'll I 'll apply and if I'm accepted well and good", "##1## And that's just how I did it", "##0## So then what was the the next stage in your career", "##1## Well uhm I applied then uh for the interview the weekend the residential interview as we call it and I was accepted for that and went on ahead did my various interviews and eventually was accepted and that meant I had to do a pastoral year there at the college at the same time working as an assistant in a church in a congregation", "##0## As you were thinking about the church and what might happen you must 've also had to bear in mind that uh you know you had two children who were growing up but also you had uh your horses and you had your other outside interests and how you were going to blend all of those", "##1## Mhm", "##1## That was difficult very difficult", "##1## I remember at one of my interviews one of the interviewers suggesting that perhaps I might give up my horses", "##1## And so well I sort of I just said him I said well have you given up your hobby", "##1## He was a very keen golfer actually which of course he hadn't", "##1## So I I just said well I I certainly wouldn't dream of giving up either my horses or my dogs", "##1## They're part of my life so it made it made more difficult definitely more difficult because you can't just move around the country with a couple of horses and three or four dogs very easily", "##0## How long have you been here in Bailieborough now", "##1## Just three months exactly three months", "##1## Stop it Jenny", "##0## This horse I think it's hungry", "##1## It could chew my coat yes", "##0## I think she's she's uh telling us something", "##1## And her just off the grass yes", "##1## I don't know what it is", "##0## So it's I suppose it's ideal for you here is it", "##1## It is", "##1## Yes it is and it's very near my own home you see which is eleven miles away", "##1## Yes it's lovely here", "##0## Tell us something about the parish here", "##1## Well in Bailieborough we have three churches one just in the town and two in the country", "##1## The Manse of course is also in the country and I 've got about a hundred and thirty families to look after", "##1## Quite a number of elderly folk but also quite a number of young folk children and young married people", "##1## This mare is determined determined to eat me isn't she or eat my coat", "##1## Yes quite a number of young people and children coming on so it's very promising for the future I think", "##1## We 've a big horse show here in Bailieborough in July and quite a number of people roundabout interested in show jumping as such and horses and very good relations with other you know churches in the community which is marvellous too very very good relationships", "##0## This horse is is hungry"],
